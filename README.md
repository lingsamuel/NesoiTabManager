# Nesoi Tab Manager for Chrome

Nesoi Tab Manager is a simple but powerful tab manager who aims to organize thousands of tabs and bookmarks.

# Main Features

## Sort Tabs by Domain, Title, or Custom Rules

In the original Chrome task manager, click a tab group or double click to jump to a specific tab will reset the scroll bar, which is very annoying.

With Nesoi, tabs can be sorted by domain, title, or custom rules. These sort options can be applied to each window, or a merged view which sort all tabs in all windows.

## Save or Bookmark Tabs

With Nesoi, tabs can be selected and then save or bookmark them all.

## Reorganize Tabs Across Window

With Nesoi, tabs can be move from window to window, which is useful when you want to reorganize your tabs by topic.

## All Features From OneTab/Better OneTab

Nesoi will support all features OneTab/Better OneTab has.

## Export/Import Data, Supports OneTab/Better OneTab

Nesoi supports export and import data to sync across different machines while there is no official sync service.

And for migration usage, OneTab/Better OneTab format is supported, too.

## Without Any Network Request

Browser data is very sensitive, Nesoi will never make any network request, keep your privacy safe.

## Bookmark Management

The Chrome bookmark manager is hard to use. Nesoi treats them as common tabs to organize, so all features above can be applied to bookmarks.
